I have resolved this ticket.

DESCRIPTION:
- When user right click on the router item and bridge item, GUI will create a router diagram and bridge diagram. When user left
click on the plus item, GUI will create a multiple bridge diagram.
- User can open router, bridge and multiple bridge info at a time in GUI.
- When user click any diagram that diagram will be displayed above.
- For router diagrams and bridge diagrams it will be turned off when user click on the X symbol in that diagram.
- For multiple bridge diagrams, it will be turned off when user click on the plus item.
- When user click on mesh or host, diagrams will be hidden except for multiple bridge diagrams.
- In bridge diagrams, when user right click on the arrow item, GUI will create a link diagram and it will be turned off when
bridge diagram have been turned off.

NOTE: In ticket GUI-2365, issue at the cfg-turnin51169 has been resolved in NS-65818, so that ticket 
fix "App crashes when searching bridgeLink and routerLink in Multiple bridge".
