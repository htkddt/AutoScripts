- In Help dialog, the detailed description of connect command is mentioned "When a connection is made between 2 router ports, 
the previous connections of those router ports are broken and left disconnected".
- I see that router ports are set default connection when user press Alt+T, so a connection is made between 2 router ports doesn't
need to be disabled on the GUI.

Question: Is router port R0.7E displayed?
