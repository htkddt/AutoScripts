LP v2 Phase-I deliverable details:
	Verification execution of LP v2 Phase I is done first on AXI-4 handwritten configs to NW configs enabling LP and host checkers along with code and functional coverage in different milestones. Conformal, CDC and RC are also part of this execution.
	Phase-I targets only for Orion-AMBA NoC and does NOT cover Orion-NSIP and GEMINI NoCs. In Orion-AMBA NoC also REGBUS is not supported and only Single Voltage domain NoC is assumed. 


Milestone 1:
-----------
Goal: 
	Compile LP RTL without CPFs and Verif collateral
Details:
	Complete LP aware RTL has to be ready for AMBA NoC
	gen_ip integration for complete LP RTL
	tune_power implementation for new v2 architecture
	Test/Coverage plan documentation

Milestone 2:
-----------
Goal:
	Verification of only AXI-4 handwritten configs exercising different NocStudio features (multiclock, multilayer and async etc.,)without LP and host checkers
Details:
	CPFs generation for AXI-4 NoCs
	PMXTOR design and integration (GenStreamX)
	Test/Coverage Plan review

Milestone 3:
-----------
Goal:
	Verification of NW generated AXI-4 configs with LP checkers and without host checkers
Details:
	CPFs generation for non AXI-4 NoCs
	LP checkers development
	Code coverage for LP on AXI-4 NoCs
	NW regression health on AXI-4 to be 80%
	CDC+RC on AXI-4 handwritten configs

Milestone 4:
-----------
Goal:
	Non AXI-4 and AXI-4 configs verification with all checkers enabled with LP code coverage
Details:
	TB Sync mechanism for enabling host checkers
	NW regression health (70% for non AXI-4 and 100% for AXI-4)
	Code coverage (AXI-4 100% and non AXI-4 70%)
	Functional coverage coding (50%)
	CDC+RC on AXI-4 configs

Milestone 5:
-----------
Goal:
	SW Verification and functional coverage goals with full blown NW regressions
Details:
	SW verification
	Functional coverage coding (100%) and goal (50%)
	CDC+RC on Non-AXI-4 configs

Milestone 6:
-----------
Goal:
	Meeting checklist items, documentation and reviews
Details:
	Functional and Code coverage (100%) with daily NW regressions
	CDC+RC on customer and super configs
	Checklist status review
